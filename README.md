# SmartTasks
Employees have various tasks to complete daily, especially off-desk workers without on-site supervision. Managers assign daily tasks, and employees document completed tasks with comments on what was done or any issues encountered. The Smart Tasks app will manage all these tasks, ensuring efficient tracking and communication.
